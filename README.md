Lesson 1 - VS Code basics, Hello World, Intro to Variables
Lesson 2 - Creating a GitHub account, repository, commit, push, fetch, pull
Lesson 3 - Basic structures - if/else, start loops?
Lesson 4 - 

To Do:
- Scrub a robot code copy for teaching & start build season templates
- brainstorm projects/puzzles for offseason
    - usefullness of skills learned
    - fun
    - challenging
    - variations/expansions of project/skills for precocious ones
- have them do Arduino projects as well?
    - ELP group seemed to enjoy it a lot - would need to be higher level/faster paced
    - use teensy and/or get some arduinos? (function basically the same but arduino is a little more user friendly)
    - use LEDs, sensors, motors? good practice
    - gets them used to working in Arduino software & C
