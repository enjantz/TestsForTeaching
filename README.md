Lesson 1: 
Lesson 2: 
Lesson 3: 
Lesson 4: 

To Do:
- Scrub a robot code copy for teaching & start build season templates
- brainstorm projects/puzzles for offseason
    - usefullness of skills learned
    - fun
    - challenging
    - variations/expansions of project/skills for precocious ones
- have them do Arduino projects as well?
    - ELP group seemed to enjoy it a lot - would need to be higher level/faster paced
    - use teensy and/or get some arduinos? (function basically the same but arduino is a little more user friendly)
    - use LEDs, sensors, motors? good practice
    - gets them used to working in Arduino software & C
